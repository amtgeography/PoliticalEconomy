Elinor Ostrom, 1990. Governing the Commons

[NOTE: Classic work in the Institutional tradition. There's a reason Ostrom won a Nobel Prize. Unfortunately later work largely abandoned any pretense of parsimony. Also, there's a good deal of systems theory insight here [Fikret Berkes is cited as and thanked, and he's big in the Adaptive Cycle world] that doesn't get explicitly states as such. Sometimes I wonder if systems theory is looked down upon in the social sciences. Which if true is a huge mistake, as there exists an opportunity for a Kuhnian paradigm shift in the social sciences powered by incorporation of general systems theory.]


CH1: Reflections on the Commons

Effective management oF The Commons widespread in human history (as are failures), but reasons poorly theorized, with three major explanations dominant
 - Hardin's Tragedy of the Commons approach argues that lack of defined property rights results in collective over-use and degradation of the commons
 - Prisoner's Dilemma perspective sees the agency of the participants and their strategic interactions as decisive, with competition leading to mutual over-exploitation
 - Collective Action theory finds the problem in incentives to free-ride on collective action, resulting in public goods under-provision

A common 'solution' prescribed is that of the Leviathan (thanks Hobbes), an entity capable of enforcing agreements, collective action
 - with simple privatization and marketization being the other major approach, predicting equlibrium due to invisible hand conceit

Ostrom argues that institutions matter, that repeat games and the need to solve collective action problems produce institutional structures that bind the community and management of the commons
 - The commons can often be effectively managed without Leviathan or defined property rights in all cases (though these help) by agreement and institutional evolution among participants


CH2: Institutional Approach

Key question: if institutions naturally arise and evolve over time, then why is there outcome variance in commons management (failures and successes)?
 - Self governance via self-organization is possible, but doesn't always work. So what are the reasons controlling success or failure?

Must be noted that Common Pool resources exist in a system comprised of stocks and flows of material things, with resource allocation key to system's operation
 - Rationality is a useful assumption, even if produced by an individual's internal world in any given situation (basically, bounded by available information/understanding)

Managing Common Pool resources require interaction and adaptation to a constantly shifting environment, with individual rationality mediating agent reactions to structural change
 - In the end, all actions taken by all agents impact all the other agents in a common pool situation, resulting in interdependence and repeat games/repeat collective action

In much of history, states and firms have/do play an important enforcement role, making sure that all parties abide by agreements, which is necessary on some level
 - Enforcement mechanisms aid in guaranteeing that actors can make credible committments to one another, keeping supply of participation going

Important to remember that actors exist at multiple levels of analysis (local/regional/global), and that rules set in one place/at one level impact another
 - Collective choice emerges as way to set behavior in local, situational context, with constitutional choice controlling broader set of rules


CH3: Analysis of Long-Enduring Commons

Alpine Swiss meadows are an old CP resource, long managed sustainably by self-organizing groups, who coordinate to set and guarantee rights and rules for appropriators
Japanese forests and agricultural lands operate in broadly similar manner, are long-lasting despite population pressures, though they relied more on overt external enforcement
Spanish irrigators have cooperated for centuries in different districts, with each developing own set of local rules, with a high degree of ongoing interaction and negotiation
Filipino irrigators have a similar experience as the Spanish, with their CP irrigation present long before colonizers arrived, using networks to control allocation

Ostrom identifies eight key factors influencing the success of these CP resource systems, that she calls 'design principles':
 - Clearly defined boundaries, however these are set and negotiated.
 - Congruence between established rules and environmental demands, so capability for adaptation
 - Collective Choice structure, allowing degree of self-governance in the day-to-day operations of the commons
 - Monitors, who estimate appropriator use of commons and identify free-riders
 - Graduated sanctions to deter rule-breakers, scaling to the degree of damage done to the commons
 - A conflict resolution process allowing for grievances and disagreements to be resolved without violence
 - A basic right to organize granted to the people in the CP system
 - Enforcement nested at multiple levels, to prevent appropriators from exploiting jurisdictional uncertainty


CH4 & CH5: Analyzing Institutional Change and Fragility

Successful collective action creates a 2nd order problem for itself, as the surplus benefits of successful resource allocation/distribution must also be distributed
 - In addition, the need for dynamism in adapting rules similarly raised the question of how collective rule-setting is done and how it modifies rules

In 20th Century Los Angeles, groundwater was tapped by multiple districts, leading to over-pumping and saltwater infiltration into the coastal aquifer
 - Due to the way water laws were set in the colonial period in early California history, all actors had an incentive to over-pump

Multiple agents with different sets of rules evolved their approaches over time, with ongoing learning and evaluation done independently
 - Eventually, those less successful were identified and effectively sanctioned, with negotiation and interaction driving move towards beneficial solution

Two fisheries in Turkey offer a counter-example, where different solutions evolving over time seem insufficient to keep the fisheries sustainable
 - Appropriators in this context face unusually high costs of cooperating and incentives to defect, undermining formation of 'good' institutions

Sri Lanka throws examples of water use (irrigation) and fisheries management that have long experienced difficulties establishing effective institutions
 - Lack of institutional capacity is a key issue, institutions tend to require proper conditions and/or structuring to work long-term


CH6: Framework for Analyzing Common Pool Resource Management with self-governance and self-organization

The baseline models used to assess CP resources (Tragedy of Commons, Prisoner's Dilemma, Collective Action) all effectively describe a special case of institutional failure
 - In the real world, people interact over time and evolve/adapt solutions to problems, enviromental or human

People can and do successfully organize to manage the commons, with success seen throughout history in absence of Leviathan or other universal enforcer
 - But certain factors make success more or less likely, many of which are under human control

Factors such as the # of decision makers, # of participants, discount rates, conjunction of interests, and presence of effective leadership all play a role
 - And it is important to note that change does occur in institutions, but it usually comes gradually and as a result of negotiation among participants

Current theories of CP resource management are insufficient because they fail to take into account self-organization and the connection between different levels of analysis
 - Information and transaction costs are also typically neglected, and institutional theory allows for these to be accounted for as part of the internal process
