Alison Johnston. 2016. From Convergence to Crisis

[Brief: Conventional wisdom has it that the Euro Crisis is a result of over-spending in certain countries, with the remedy/prescription being austerity/budget control. However, institutional factors offer a better explanation for divergent trajectories in the Eurozone, rooted in the loss of crucial signal-adjustment mechanisms that had previously caused inflation rate convergence across Europe and the differences in labor relations between the European north and south. Inability to discipline public sector unions in the south created sectoral wage inflation not directly subject to market pressures. Existing centralized wage-setting institutions in the north tied public and private sector (export-focused) wages together. This divide has had deep macroeconomic implications, best resolved by spending increases in northern economies to offset balance-of-trade differences between north and south, aiding southern exporter competitiveness]


Over-spending in the PIIGS (European south) is commonly cited as the driver of their economic collapse and the resulting crisis in the Eurozone, as their bond yields skyrocketed
 - Austerity suggested as the remedy, and this has been forced on many southern economies with predictably unpleasant local results, including the rise of extremist parties

However, a move sophisticated view takes into account the role of institutions, both in terms of a nation's past history as well as incentive structures embedded in the economy
 - Broadly speaking, Europe's north and south have different cultural backgrounds and different labor-management relations, which have created institutional variation

In particular, northern europe has a history of labor-management relations that evolved towards centralized wage-setting across the economy, while the south lacks this
 - Pre-Euro, the institutional results of these differences were resolved via macroeconomic factors, and largely lost in the fabric of European inter-competition

Monetary Union altered the relationship between countries within the Eurozone, and removed certain key signal/adjustment mechanisms (tied to monetary policy) from play
 - Prior to the Euro, competition on international markets had produced convergence in growth/inflation rates, but this reversed post-Euro

Essentially, by losing the ability to independently set monetary policy (currency value) states lost a means of controlling wage growth across all sectors of society
 - In the north, centralized wage-setting tied all sectors together, and their manufacturing emphasis tied all wages to the global economy
 - In the south, by-sector wage-setting allowed differentiation, and public-sector union employees successfully fought for wage growth, funded by debt

This divergence helped produced the debt-crisis in the south, as northern European states accumulated trade surpluses and ownership of southern European debt
 - an unsustainable bubble that burst, producing predictable responses by northern lenders - austerity and repayment of all debts, despite economic hardship

Monetary union was supposed to economically benefit all members of the EU, providing a stable and strong currency accessible by all members
 - Much like having a common currency benefits Americans, with economic transactions becoming more difficult if, hypothetically, all 50 states had their own currencies

But lacking the ability to discipline labor unions across all sectors and prevent wage growth, southern states suffered constant wage inflation post-Euro
 - Matters made worse by the lack of wage growth in the manufacturing sector, which exposed workers to inflation and wage stagnation simultaneously

The profligate borrowing by southern governments was in large part due to the demand for high wages among government employees, who had little interest to rein in their own wages
 - A situation enabled by the northern governments on two fronts: one, their committment to trade surpluses; two, their having so much extra cash to lend to the south

This situation cannot be easily remedied by austerity, as wage growth in the export-oriented sectors isn't the issue, high wages in the non-traded sectors are
 - Instead, increasing wages in the north's manufacturing sector (and reduced trade surplus) can mitigate the imbalance

Higher wages in the northern export sector would stimulate local demand, and both would tend to boost southern exports - and eventually local wages
 - But northern countries would have to accept lower trade surplus levels and likely lower corporate profits as wages increase

Still, the benefits of offering a pathway out of the debt crisis that doesn't rely on wage-crippling austerity and reduction in social services are worth the temporary difficulty
 - Because north and south remain linked, repayment of debts will be much more likely if southern economies receive a relative boost, a win for northern lenders
