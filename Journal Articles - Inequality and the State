Political Economy Notes - Selection on Political Economy of Inequality and the State

Focusing on inter-group interactions that produce the 'state'




Becker, 1983

Competition for political favors produces government correction of market failures, but mostly for the powerful who have ability to influence in pursuit of subsidies

Individuals exist in society as members of groups defined by common characteristics, these groups compete in politics to produce equilibrium level of tax and subsidies

Dead Weight Loss is incurred by taxation that has proportionate impacts on the taxed and the subsidies received, but resistance to tax overall defined by the likely outcome

Proposition 1: Efficiency in deploying pressure on politicians enhances ability to lower tax or raise subsidy felt by one's self, with relative group efficiency defining effectiveness

Proposition 2: Higher tax lowers the equilibrium subsidy by increasing taxpayer pressure to not tax, so efficient tax policy favored (pushes burden of compensating on taxed)

Proposition 3: Successful groups tend to be smaller relative to the size of the group being taxed,
 - Proposition 4:  Competition among pressure groups promotes efficient taxation, mitigating pressure for subsidies (political invisible hand)

Becker's approach is different than most used in game theory and utilized fewer assumptions, and also does not need to rely on social welfare functions or other constructs
 - Emphasizes the role of inter-group competition in regulating the pressure for subsidies to counteract experienced tax burdens, as groups fight one another rather than game the gov't
 - This thus mitigates some of the risk of small and cohesive groups using their efficiency superiority to shift tax burdens or boost self subsidies (have to pay to fight the other sides)


North & Weingast 1989

Politics underpins economics and markets because of its role in institutional rules and enforcement mechanisms, with role of rules and ability to determine the rules essential to market systems

Economic growth depends on a ruler's willingness to credibly commit to certain rules, with a ruler having the theoretical ability to set rules by precedent (flexible) or by contract (fixed)
 - Rulers usually tend to choose fixed rules because of the difficulty of enforcing rules set by precedent and their relative lack of credibility

The 'Glorious Revolution' in Britain saw restrictions be forced on the crown, and subsequently the crown was able to access credit to a far greater degree than before
 - These were also 'freely-given' loans, in contrast to the crown's former tendency to extort 'loans', usually without intending to repay them

Authors argue that the Glorious Revolution was in part produced by past economic growth, and saw a major institutional correction be forced on the crown to enable further growth
 - This was necessary because the sovereign's capabilities to unilaterally act undermined the ability to trust any promise made by the sovereign

Overthrow of the reigning monarch in the Glorious Revolution set a precedent, which had the effect of motivating elite reform more than promising future revolutionary threats
 - And it also shifted emphasis towards the ruler enacting and obeying formal rules rather than arbitrary or crown-selected rule enforcement

The lack of Britain's ruler having a standing army may have been the decisive difference in Britain's monarchy, with Spain and France able to suppress dissent by force until they couldn't
 - Admittedly, pursuing counterfactuals here is difficult. But the evidence of contemporary statements demonstrates the intent behind the parties involved


McGuire & Olson 1996

In an anarchic environment, 'roving bandits' have little to steal because no one has an incentive to invest in anything, so securing territory and guaranteeing stable taxation essential
 - Basically, a wise bandit settles down in an area and finds a level of continuous taxation acceptable to locals that gives them incentive to accumulate capital (to tax)

Subjects end up better off if this 'ruler' settles down and develops an 'encompassing interest' in managing the territory and moderating its own bad behavior to preserve rents
 - They also win out because the ruler has to bear costs of taxation and provision of public goods, solving the locals' collective action problems for them

An invisible hand effect is in operation that pushes the system towards an equilibriun level of public goods provision, and elemental pressures underpin both democracy and autocracy

Formal models demonstrate the logic driving this pattern, and show that in the end either a democratic-utopian or autocratic-totalitarian society converge in terms of public-goods provision

Self-Interested autocrat essentially rent seeking, and creates a push to cultivate rents, so will always limit own theft/tax to maximize rents (a bit like a monopolist)
 - Democratic governments are no different, but mediate the process with institutions and public choice, letting groups compete for the role of ruler

Admittedly this argument represents a severe abstraction from reality, and assumes all players have fixed time horizons (can realize the benefit of being a 'ruler' rather than bandit)

But while biased in favor of autocracies, still, this explains the persistence of autocracy. Regimes exist on a continuum, and the behavior of US presidents offers evidence of 'encompassing interest'
 - That is, Presidents typically act to secure the office and the nation, and tend to insulate from the political battles fought in the legislature


Bardhan 1997

Corruption is an old problem, but hard to define in practice. Legality is often substituted for corruption, but this ignores the ability of power-holders to define corruption

One strand in economics actually argues that corruption is a non-problem, that what we call corruption is a natural free market correction to government-induced inefficiency

This has obvious, numerous problems and completely ignores the abundance of empirical evidence from the developing world that shows the damage wrought by corruption
 - in many contexts, a payment to slow down someone else's paperwork is a common form of corruption, that seems to indicate a clear breach of efficiency in normal economic terms

Corruption clearly places the private interest over the public interest, with public goods provision suffering accordingly

Cultural differences in perception of what constitutes corruption and its impacts are important, with state 'fees' seen as no different than 'Baksheesh' by many despite the former's 'legality'

Mitigating corruption via incentive payments for good behavior often discussed, but difficult to put into practice given the inherent degree of information uncertainty

The 'state as bandit' view of Olson and others is also uncertain, because corruption can persist even in a weak state, even becoming crucial to that state's survival


Lohmann 1998

Politicians have two basic channels of political control over monetary policy, they can threaten the existence of the central bank or influence those who run/govern it

Germany's Central Bank system is interesting as it is formally independent with this independence supported by the Federal system of government, though behavior is tied to party power

The bank's governor appointments are subject to pressure from the different states, preserving independence at the cost of unified action - a feature of the German system

Composition of the bank's controllers at any given point in time and the severity of the current economic situation are both relevant in understanding behavior/decisions

On the whole it has notably resisted inflationary pressures typically pushed by politicians, but staff composition is noticeably affected by political changes

Germany as case supports a view of central banks as neither wholly subject to institutional rules, nor do institutions fail to matter in the face of political pressure

Different institutional configurations differentially affect bank components, and political players tend to simply write in veto rules when they are in a temporary position of power

Essentially, results support the view that hard institutional rules are often set by party-in-power as a hedge against parties out of power taking unilateral action


Wallerstein 1999

Wage inequality is present in many countries and times, and this variation allows for analysis that shows that the level (individual/industry/national) wage bargaining takes place is crucial

Collective barganining or government-private sector collective negotiation can both work, though higher concentration of union memberships does have a more consistent effect

However it occurs, centralized bargaining has the tendency to control wage inequality by producing wage convergence across all affected sectors

Wage inequality is heavily influenced by institutions, and the individual wage bargaining increasingly common after the 1980s is a key driver of broader income inequality

National institutions appear to have a stronger effect than union membership, and in terms of the W90/W10 ratio (percentile ratio as an indicator of inequality) USA worst in developed world

Centralized wage-setting appears to create a wage 'floor', while allowing a degree of bargaining at the margin to occur (though this is constrained to some degree)

This effect is robust to inclusion of key controls including partisanship, international openness, size of the public sector, and education levels

Further research is needed to understand the mechanics/dynamics, but evidence clear that a convergence/wage inequality mitigation bias present wherever wages are centrally set


Luttmer, 2001

Interpersonal Preferences hard to detect in practice, and typically observed via surveys, which indicate that this is a key factor in linking welfare attitudes to incomes
 
Comparing survey results in California elections shows that people tend to oppose benefits they perceive as disproportionately benefiting "other" groups

30% of observed variance in welfare benefit levels in study area can be attributed to interpersonal preferences, with racial composition and redistribution preferences connected

Welfare recipients of those who are or might be likely to be in need of welfare benefits are more pro-welfare, with more wealthy tending to oppose welfare benifits in general

Own group bias is highly explanatory, and negative exposure bias (bad experiences) also present, with Metro stat. area and tract levels showing racial heterogeneity tied to welfare opposition

Deeper mechanisms underlying this relationship are uncertain, and this piece emphasizes only the empirics, but group loyalty on racial, ethnic, religious grounds likely play role

In essence, people appear to reduce their support for welfare when they observe people from other groups (usually in close proximity) receive it, and race magnifies the effect

Welfare support not solely tied to income, though this relationship is strong, and results counter views of income being sole determining factor in welfare support levels


Moene & Wallerstein, 2001

There is a long standing debate in economic modeling on effects of inequality on welfare, with baseline model focusing on median voter and arguing high inequality boosts support for redistribution

Welfare however in reality is targeted, with different types of welfare present in a society, and this has important implications for perceptions of the welfare state

Incorporating an insurance-model view, where citizens support the welfare state as a hedge against poverty, shows that increased inequality can undermine support for the welfare state

The focus in such a model is on the gap between median and mean incomes, with higher gaps indicating higher levels of inequality, that are experience differently based on one's own income

Proposition 1: a mean preserving spread reduces median level of benefits targeted at the unemployed, shifting benefits towards those who are employed

Proposition 2: A mean preserving increase in inequality tends to reduce wage earner support for unemployment benefits, creating a quadratic relationship contingent on level of inequality

Essentially, welfare is both an insurance mechanism and a redistribution mechanism, with extreme levels of inequality or equality making the insurance effect of the welfare state > redistribution

This model is, however, sensitive to country effects, and demonstrate that finding the right grain of analysis is important in future research


Austen-Smith & Wallerstein, 2006
 
Racial politics are bound up with the welfare system, especially in the US. Policy dimensions are often discussed in literature, but political economy less so

PE rarely addresses race other than to employ descriptive characteristics, this paper introduces formal model that brings in social cleavage effects

A tradeoff exists between job opportunities for all and affirmative action, from an economic perspective where preferences are automatically accounted for

So income redistribution and racial/ethnic redistribution are bound together, with evidence from US legislative process supporting this view

Breaking up labor markets by race and quality of job produces equilibrium model, rather than assume assignment to jobs by skill alone

Lemma 1: Firms under Affirmative Action create lower quality thresholds for blacks, which produces loss relative to total jobs offered to blacks

Lemma 2: But AA also induces reduction in proportion of whites eligible for good jobs, so more opportunities emerge overall for blacks when output increases

Lemma 3: Small efficiency gains nets a benefit to whites overall, compensating for their losses, but if there is a great disparity between the high and low quality jobs, costs overwhelm effect

Proposition 1: AA as policy reduces total fiscal redistribution relative to no AA, and legislative effects follow as black legislators increase pressure for more redistribution

Proposition 2: Gains accord to blacks in both job types and whites who can keep quality jobs, but whites in lower quality jobs lose under AA policies

Proposition 3: Eventually AA becomes unncessary as the white/black outcomes emerge, and Prop 4: When job quality gap declines, AA becomes less relevant


Lizzeri & Persico 2004

Threat of revolution commonly cited as reason for democratization, with elites allowing suffrage expansion primarily to mitigage threat of being overthrown by populace
 - But authors present another model, where elites themselves press for democratization/ suffrage expansion in order to stabilize the political system and mitigate rent-seeking

By providing greater incentives to politicians to meet public needs by exposing them to voting pressures, elites mitigate inter-elite competition for access to politicians

Historically elites have been forced to compete for access to political favors, which is a waste from their perspective, and limiting this is beneficial

Public works expenditures increased in the European industrial period, which was valuable to elites but also a source of rent-seeking and waste as politicians offered favors to elite voters
 - All in all, the system's efficiency was damaged and elites faced uncertainty as a result of the conflict over patronage resources

Universal suffrage is actually pareto-improving for elites, who no longer have to spend as much competing with one another, with the public disciplining politicians at the polls
 - Some are indifferent or lose initially, but improved system function benefits all, creating incentives to expand suffrage further

In 19th century Britain suffrage expansion came progressively despite realistic threat of revolution, and was pushed by many elites
 - Who overall wanted to discipline public expenditures and focus them on improvements that would benefit public at large, not wasteful pork projects common at the time

Franchise reform was particuarly associated with public health spending, which was not typically an area of patronage and old corruption, so elites backed public investment here

The model presented by the authors supplements existing models, showing that revolution isn't always necessary to produce democratization, elite interests can endogenously promote suffrage


Piketty & Saez, 2007

The US tax system has gotten less progressive over the course of the 20th century, with the top 1% of population seeing a halving of effective tax rates
 - Simultaneously, social security and medicare taxes are regressive, and place a higher relative burden on the lower and middle classes, increasing their effective tax rate

Most analysis breaks up the tax population into quintiles, and show the tax system as remaining progressive (though less so than in the 1960s)
 - Focusing on the top quintile and breaking it into income bands useful and demonstrates a reversal in progressiveness affecting the highest earners

Over time, this particular bracket has seen a dramatic decline in effective rates, going from nearly 70% in the 1950s to less than 40% in the 1990s
 - An examination of tax rates in the US, UK, and France demonstrate a common trajectory, mitigated to a higher degree in France than in the Anglo-Saxon world

Regressive taxes have tended to increase in all cases, however in France higher degree of welfare benefit provision mitigates this regressiveness to some degree
 - And there has been marked convergence over time, with all highest-earners able to push for declining tax rates since the 1960s

But the Anglo Saxon world has largely eliminated estate taxes and other special taxes that used to apply to the wealthy, while France has maintained a wealth tax on richest
 - Inequality in the Anglo-Saxon countries has dramatically increased in this time period in large part as a result of the dramatic reduction in effective tax rates on the wealthiest


Acemoglu & Robinson, 2008

Change in political institutions alters de jure power distribution, but creates de facto investment opportunities, allowing an elite to control economic institutions even in nominal democracy

Institutional connection in economics and politics depends on the transformation fo power, with de jure improvement offset by de facto deployment of power by those who have it

In their model Economic institutions are chosen by those with current political power, which depends on de jure (institutional) allocations and de facto (present) distributions
 - This creates an elite-citizen contest, mediated by institutions, and implies that when elites have too much power they tend to use it to promote less pro-citizen policies

The US South serves as an example - slavery was replaced by a wage labor system characterized by regular use of violence against low-wage (predominantly black) workers
 - So political institutional change was matched by a shift in economic institutions, with economic elites imposing a new set of controls on black economic power

Such a pattern of captured democracy is also seen in Latin America, where elites will accept democratic reform but subsequently capture the process to control policy

Labor repression may be higher in captured democracties relative to even non-democracies due to this elite-citizen context, with small-group coordination benefits making elite cooperation easier

To avoid such capture, democratization needs to be accompanied by citizen control or incorporate a reduction in elite ability to source rents from the system

Political Economy often assumes that stable institutions are present, but these can and do change, this model helps incorporate understanding of persistence and change


Schove & Stasavage, 2010

The rise of electoral democracy is usually credited with the increase in government wealth redistribution that occurred starting in the early 20th century with adoption of income taxes

However, this argument neglects the crucial role played by the demands placed on government and society by mass warfare in the industrial age, and the perception that the wealthy benefit too much

While universal suffrage and political development are important factors, they are insufficient to explain adoption of redistribution unless the effects of mass warfare are considered

Mass warfare as emerged in the 19th and 20th centuries required incredible sacrifice on a social level, and citizens tend to demand that the wealthy share in the collective burden

A difference-in-difference estimation indicates that participation in the World Wars in particular is associated with the increase in marginal tax rates on the wealthy

Contra Piketty, who sees the destruction of elite fortunes as accident of history allowing emergence of progressive tax system
- Also contra Acemoglu & Robinson, who argue that tax progressivity is a function of increasing equality in the political system

Mass warfare creates a broad class of veterans who gain, by grace of their perceived sacrifice, added voice in the political process
 - in Acemoglu and Robinson's frame, they have de facto power postwar and can use it to impose sacrifices on the wealthy concomitant with their own

Conscription in the post-Napoleonic era began such pressures, but the demands of total war in World War I dramatically intensified the process

The results of this work indicate that the character and type of sacrifices made by powerful groups is important to consider, and equilibrium assumptions are not the sole explanatory mechanism


Blaydes & Chaney 2014

The Western (Carolingian and successors) and Islamic worlds experienced divergence in ruler length-of-tenure after the end of the 8th century, with Islamic sultans holding power for less time
 - This result is robust to a wide variety of controls, and is indeed 'real' - Sultans began to hold power for shorter periods of time than Kings

Authors argue that increased tenure brought increased stability, and that laid the foundations for subsequent political and economic development in Europe rather than Egypt

The underlying mechanism at work is the adoption of productive tensions between ruler and other elites in the West, which tend to constrain executive power 
 - the West's feudal institutions broke up the sovereign's power, making unilateral action difficult and forcing sovereigns to negotiate with other elites

Sultans, by contrast, tended to base their military and administrative power on the Mamluk class, usually foreign-born individuals bought as slaves then trained to be warriors/bureaucrats
 - This gave a tremendous level of power to Sultans, who could over-reach and then be subject to overthrow, often by the Mamluk's themselves

The 'Glorious Revolution' occurred in Britain, not Egypt, because of this difference in degree of power accorded to rulers and development of power-sharing institutions in the West
 - Stability was fostered, which was self-reinforcing, and produced a tradition of executive restraint in Western society not seen in Islamic world

Authoritarian regime persistence is partly explained by this effect, as rulers can rely on power to avoid revolution. Though, inevitably, there comes a time when this fails.

[My Note: There's an insight here, but by and large this paper is so biased by a reflexive reliance on conventional Western 'wisdom' about our own history that it comes off (to me) as yet another 'hah hah, the West is better' piece. I know enough of the history in this period to recognize that they are taking a cartoon version of both the Western and Islamic worlds' political systems and extrapolating a way-too convenient result. So while their insight about regime persistence and power sharing is essentiall correct, their argument is built on vulnerable foundations. If you are going to compare social systems in history, you simply can't ignore the rest of the world. Feudalism existed in many societies throughout history, yet the 'Glorious Revolution' didn't occur in Japan or China. And Western feudalism itself emerged from the syncretism between Roman/Christian and Germanic cultural patterns, so its own antecedents are crucial here.]


Goldin 2014

The Gender Gap in wages has diminished in recent decades, which is a significant accomplishment that has produced marked convergence in incomes in the United States

Achieving full labor equity may not be a matter for direct government information, and may be accomplished by restructuring of firms and/or labor market patterns

There exists a tendency to reward employees who work long hours, and sectoral differences in terms of this expectation are a major factor reinforcing the gender gap

Law and Business are noted for demanding high number of hours of employees, with higher hours worked viewed as the pathway to career success and future earnings improvements

There is actually relative equity between the genders in the early-career years, with divergence observed and accelerating at the mid-career point, when women typically make fertility choices.

Lack of flexible scheduling is a major factor explaining sectoral differences, with some jobs (pharmacy) having a low gender wage gap as well as hours substitutability

Industries that place a premium on high hours and constant availability tend to damage women's prospects more, as they tend to experience greater burdens due to childcare in our society

All but the wage-earners who value high incomes and/or disvalue leisure time suffer under this system, and reforms would re-balance for everyone
