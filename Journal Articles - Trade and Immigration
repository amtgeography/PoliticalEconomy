Political Economy Notes - Selection on Political Economy of Trade and Immigration

Focusing on the flow of capital and labor between states.


Alt & Gilligan 1994

International Trade poses a fundamental problem - it has definite benefits, but also causes negative impacts on some. More choice and better goods, but individuals in some industries unemployed

Policy coalitions form out of individuals and groups in order to advocate, causing a linkage between domestic and international spheres relevant to undertanding trade relations

Collective action problems beset advocacy groups, with transaction costs ever-present, and larger groups tend to experience higher costs of organizing and more uncertain outcomes

Stolper-Samuelson model argues that changes in price level more than proportionately increase returns to relevant capital, so capital abundant country sees capital win and labor lose in free trade

Ricardo-Viner model says that capital is not free flowing (nor is labor), and the increase price effect is more ambiguous, controlled by local consumption patterns and labor type

Scarce factor tends to favor trade restrictions, while the abundant factor tends to favor open trade, with policy coalitions naturally forming around expected imports

Neither model alone can fully explain trade coalition emergence, institutions are also relevant but separate from factor mobility

Cost of collective action key to understanding what groups form, with intervening institutions also relevant to the outcome


Bailey, Goldstein, & Weingast 1997

Economists tend to agree that free trade boosts social welfare, but they don't agree on what policy conditions give rise to public support for free trade
 - Conventional view is that anti-trade interests have powerful incentive to organize and resist open trade agreements, and small-group bias makes coordination harder

However, free trade has been supported in the US since the 1940s at the legislative level, with marked convergence in voting patterns between the two major US parties
 - RTAA was designed by the dominant democrats to prevent future republican-controlled legislature from attacking the RTAA and associated free-trade deals

They were able to achieve this by bundling domestic and international level issues, and then subsequent growth in trade undercut Congressional anti-trade tendencies
 - A new institutional arrangement was build and imposed, that was able to set consistent future rules, and became self-supporting

RTAA functions because of an overlap between the trade preferences of enough democrats overlapped with those of enough foreign countries, allowing an equilibrum reduction in tariffs
 - Subsequent effect was to grow national income, which altered preferences for trade in such a way that the median voter became pro-free trade via shifting indifference curves

This demonstrates that trade liberalization was driven forward despite loss of support on far left, because population of median voters larger (lots of people benefitted from trade)
 - This enabled further entrenchment of free-trade institutions, which survived despite generally bad economic conditions in the 1970s and constant nativist rhetoric


Hathaway, 1998

Openness of US Economy in '70s and '80s a puzzle for political economy, as despite an overall bad economy and foreign competition pressures protectionism in the US declined

Determinants of protection demanded by key industries under-examined in PE, with reduction in barriers showing positive feedbacks that appear to undermine protectionism

Industries can adjust to markets, or deploy their lobbying 'voice' in the political system, in the US context there are two routes for achieving this (legislative, administrative)

Industries tend to focus on potential benefits of lobbying and chances of success, with both being influenced by the outcome of past attempts at using their 'voice'

Potential benefits are controlled by capital intensity, trade dependence, and factor specificity, with success chance tid to receptiveness in the administration or legislature, + industry size/situation

This produces a tendency towards reduces protection over time once requests for protection are denied, because voice becomes less attractive and market adjustments mitigate need for protection

Supplier induced demand in trade policy is real, so keeping the supply low is important, with efficiency and competitiveness better policy focus than protection


Bagwell & Staiger 1999

Authors present a unified framework theorizing GATT - General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, using equilibrium model common to economics to demonstrate rationale for status quo

GATT is distinctive by mandating reciprocity and non-discrimination in trade negotiations as key rules, which functions by assisting governments find their efficient 'solution'

Basic issue in trade: preferential agreements between countries reduce trade efficiencies, and GATT or the World Trade Organization have, by mitigating, brought increase global trade

Government in model is assumed to be welfare-maximizing, and has an interest to reduce trade barriers to promote optimal welfare, but hindered by formal barriers to free trade

Governments as actors are exposed to population's pressures, and care about 'terms of trade', seeking optimal political tariff
 - this means that customs unions can play a negative role in a free market system by tying trade to rent-seeking by political groups


Mansfield, Milner, & Rosendorff, 2000

Whether trade depends on domestic institutions under-examined in Political Economy, and authors present formal model demonstrating democracies tend to lower trade barriers among one another

Democracies have checks between the legislative and executive in most cases, which allows citizen preferences to be expressed in the process as part of regular function

Autocracies vest more power in the executive, and this makes it harder to know the true preferences of the government in question (democratic processes produce information)

In democracies, consumers who are better off under open-trade can use their benefits to influence legislators, while in autocracies rent-seeking is tied to the executive

Both autocracies and democracies must respond to citizen preferences, but democracy makes the process more transparent, allowing two democracies to better observe one another's preferences

A gravity model common in trade analysis (more trade with proximate partners) still demonstrates that two democracies tend to have a significantly higher level of trade relative to autoc-democ pair

Foreign policy distinctiveness is often considered key to explaining trade relationships, but democratic pressures tend to produce convergence in trade policy

Dyads with democratic-autocracy pairing experience 15-20% less trade than democracy-democracy diads, with the effect enhancing to 40% in the 1990s

Autocratic dyads, however, trade with one another at the same volume as do democratic pairs, indicating the presence of institutional effects


Rose 2004

Economists tend to agree that free trade is good for society, but this agreement has led to uncritical acceptance of the idea that trade is good and orgs like WTO boost trade volumes

However, a standard gravity model of trade (proximate countries trade more) coupled with a suite of controls fails to show a significant effect of GATT/WTO membership on trade

Using a purely empirical argument lacking any theoretical underpinnings allows for a data-focused analysis of actual indicators, which show little to no real statistical relationship

Results of modeling alongside specification shifts and other common tests indicate that the signal from WTO membership is overwhelmed by the signal of general trade increases observed
 - this doesn't necessarily mean that the WTO isn't relevant, but that there is no direct causal link given the available data

Future research could segregate analysis by industry for a more direct apples-to-apples comparison, given that different industries in a country experience trade differently

But the result demonstrates that uncritical acceptance of free trade boosting institutional membership is not yet warranted.


Singer 2010

Immigration interacts with exchange rate regimes via remittances, which are a widespread (global) phenomenon and one of the most important international capital flows

There is strong evidence that remittances are factored into national policy as they tend to be stable over time and counter-cyclic with respect to recipient economy

Analysis of exchange rate regimes developing world over a quarter-century demonstrates a tendency for recipient-country policy makers to adopt fixed exchange rates

Remittances comprise more than 5% of GDP in 42 developing countries, and in some like Jordan and Haiti they comprise up to 15% of total GDP, >300 billion worldwide

Remittances tend to pose problems for analysis as they are not captured in normal capital flow metrics, and are invisible using most contemporary data

But they are as important in terms of magnitude as Foreign Direct Investment, and function as a lifeline to the poor in developing regions

Normally, nations prefer floating exchange rates in order to preserve flexibility in adapting to the global economy, but fixed rates are beneficial for those who rely on remits
 - Fixed rates do damage a nation's ability to counteract economic cycle effects, so are a hazard, as any temporary benefits experienced get arbitraged away by capital movement

Support for fixed exchange rates tied to differential group benefits within society, with the relevance of remittances to enough people making it an important domestic factor in policy


Mansfield & Mutz 2009

Public attitudes about trade have been insufficiently studies, with two main models in political economy seeing attitudes as tied to trade or income impacts

Authors present survey analysis that shows little support for this view, rather demonstrating that out-group anxiety is a better predictor of attitudes

They appear to condition preferences by looking at the overall state of the economy, indicating that sociotropic factors play a key role

The standard welfare focus largely ignores the fact that most people don't cognitively connect the local to the global, they adjust attitudes based on perceptions of broader social problems

Sociotropic models ultimately hinge on information and perception, with individuals not wholly 'rational' in classical sense, preferences visible via surveys and subsequent statistical analysis

Education is the other factor in author's data that plays a major role in governing views on trade, as Hainmuller and Hiscox find, with other factors not significant (self-interest)

The relevance of sociotropic effects are not accounted for in most political-economy models, with cross-national comparisons being a logical next step in research


Hainmueller & Hiscox 2010

Concerns about immigration are usually portrayed as being tied to concern about competition for jobs and access to services
 - so natives should either dislike immigrants with a similar skill set or generally prefer to limit all low-skilled immigration in general

Author's results indicate that all natives usually oppose low-skilled immigration, with poorer natives concerns over welfare competition the most significant factor
 - Rich do dislike the expansion of welfare spending, but this effect outweighed by the effect of both natives and recent immigrants being concerned about loss of services

Economic self-interest fails to take into account these attitudes, as a greater population of welfare recipients should result in greater political power and welfare spending
 - Ethnocentrism and/or sociotropic effects are likely at play, showing the limitations of contemporary political-economic models

Labor Market focused explanations fail, as higher skill/education levels correspond to global preferences for more immigration

Fiscal burden argument fails, because cross-state analysis shows that the states most impacted by increased welfare spending are not more anti-immigrant, despite the burden posed

Fears about public service overcrowding is better supported by this data, and is present in regions not directly exposed to low-skill immigration pressures

Separating attitudes about high-skill versus low-skill immigration in surveys is necessary to understand citizen preferences with respect to immigration
 - Results clearly show the perception of immigration being conditioned by fear of their impact on welfare state, with poor residents fearing contraction of benefits

Cross-national evidence and modeling is needed to better understand how these effects translate between societies, with issues of racism and ethnocentrism here seen as decisive


Peters, 2014

Businesses understand trade-offs in trade, overseas production, and immigration. IPE has ignored this area due to emerging in postwar era and tendency to see it as domestic issue

US immigration policy not explained by immigrant lobby or organized labor strength, and nativist pressures are too common across time and space to fully explain immigration policy

Low Skilled Immigration Policy (LSIP) is driven by the level of free trade and the mobility of capital, with post 1950 US Senator votes offering evidence of causality

Trade openness and capital mobility explain senator voting patterns, with ideology, welfare spending, unemployment, GDP growth, % foreign born in population all insignificant

Free movement of capital and trade eliminates key lobby for pro-LSIP, as firms are able to move to labor and therefore no longer rely on open borders for labor

LS immigrants tend to be both more visible and more frequently targeted in US history, while HS more supported. Other Anglo-Saxon countries do restrict LSI but in different ways

LS employing firms faced with international pressures must raise their efficiency or move, but increasing efficiency creates demand for HS workers, and moving lowers demand for LS

This theory is robust to multiple specifications, and further boosted by examining metrics associated with firm lobbying levels, showing LSIP/HSIP relationship
