Peter Swenson. 2002. Capitalists Against Markets

[Brief: Counters the common narrative of the welfare state having emerged from the outcome of labor vs. management struggles in the early-mid 20th century, with Sweden a paradigmatic case of a country with strong unions and the USA one with weak/sectorally variable unions. As a result, this perspective argues, Sweden evolved a strong 'socialist' welfare state and the USA a more contingent and persistently weakened version. However, this ignores the fact of heterogeneity in the management population. A more historically-focused comparison of the USA and Sweden reveals a more complex story. That is, one where both labor and management are non-homogeneous, giving rise to different strategies and historic trajectories]

Part I: History and Theory

Relative weakness of USA welfare state vs. Sweden usually explained as a result of either lack of labor power or arguments about American exceptionalism, with both inadequate
 - Lack of strong labor unions across all sectors and lack of dedidates pro-labor political party core of first, second emphasizes America's institutional differences

Sweden's development of strong welfare state however not in line with evidence, progress was contingent and Sweden lagged behind US in early 20th century
 - Labor unions themselves were not decisive in development of Swedish welfare state, but employer solidarity and desire to control labor markets

Capitalists are not a homogeneous group, with sectoral differences in factors of production leading to different strategies for controlling labor markets, producing disunion
 - They compete for labor, and often undercut one another's access to quality labor by offering perks and other benefits above and beyond wages, pushing compensation upward

Three different modes of interaction are common: cartelism, segmentalism, syndicalism, each hinging on the degree to which employers can act in solidarity
 - Cartelism relies on employers working together to influence labor markets, but incentive to offer higher wages produces tendency towards defection from cartel
 - Segmentalism sees significant competition for labor that forces wages upward as employers battle for the most productive employees, particularly in marginal economic sectors
 - Syndicalism promotes centralized wage-setting across as many sectors as possible to globally influence labor system and punish defectors, pushes benefits into government sphere

Cartelism tends to fail as employers cheat, with control maintained primarily in large oligarchic industries where coordination is less difficult and there is less pressure to compete
Segmentalism tends to occur wherever employers can't cooperate, wages in certain sectors rise, and sectoral differences predominate, splitting the labor supply
Syndicalism tends to bypass the segmentalism problem by promoting centralized wage setting and benefit controls, keeping wages under control where employers can forge common interest

Unions tend to be co-opted under syndicalism because they have little leverage when employers coordinate across the entire economy, threatening lockouts in cases of unrest
 - Unions in the United States have always tended to be sectoral, and certain industries have never been conducive to union formation 

Part II: Evidence

History of US Labor relations is fraught, with unions often over-estimating their power and producing violent counter-reaction by employers
 - But more marginal and competitive sectors could offer high wages to productive employees, undermining incentives to unionize, keeping unions sectoral

Early attempts at cartelism between large employers fell apart by early 20th century, due to increasing pressures to compete for quality labor and lack of control of wages
 - This produced a movement towards the segmentalist system, with labor-management struggles occurring in some sectors and not others

Unions inadvertently exacerbated the situation by targeting labor-unfriendly employers, creating incentives to avoid allowing unionization via coercion or payoffs
 - This lack of unity was institutionalized over time, and produced America's weak welfare state, as labor-management conflicts extreme in some sectors but not others

This sectoral variance creates strong unions and strong employers and a degree of cartelism in some areas, but not globally, undermining support for welfare state
 - Where it emerged, it was largely due to a desire for preventing labor conflict and to protect capitalism, with Roosevelt seeing himself as capitalism's savior

The wars of the 20th century did little to change the dynamic, with unions suppressed in some sectors but irrelevant in others, wage setting heavily controlled
 - Partial implementation of welfare state after the wars never had the degree of broad support as in Sweden, as some employers were hostile and others not concerned

Sweden by contrast evolved an early form of syndicalism in the national lockouts pre-war, and the wars forced significant constriction of wages
 - Wages in Sweden markedly less variable than in the US, but cheating was an endemic problem as employers tried to compete despite the syndicalist advantages

Need to stop this cheating and the improving post-war economic situation drove centralized wage-setting into centralized benefits - the early welfare state
 - State guarantees of benefits kept them at the same basic level, reduced employer need to offer them, and reinforced wage standardization and control

As employers and unions became used to the centralized system, struggles over the welfare state focused on the degree of benefits offered, not who would be given them
 - Where in the US, the welfare state has always been tied to employment status and not needed by those whose employers offered generous compensation packages

Part III: Implications

In the US, many businesses came to see the welfare state as an ally, reducing their need to compete for employees and stabilizing the labor system
 - as a side benefit, mass-unionization was avoided in the USA because many sectors did not produce strong unionization pressures

Sweden saw the welfare state evolve as a global solution to a collective action problem, mitigating employer incentives to cheat and compete for labor
 - The wars strongly impacted Sweden, adding to the pressure for solidarity in order to avoid falling to segmentalist trap

Social Democracy in Sweden was controversial, strongly opposed, and subject to rollback, but businesses by and large saw the advantages and accepted the system
 - Labor too saw the benefit, and the need for major labor actions was undercut by the presence of a welfare state stabilizing economic outcomes

The violent resistance by many US employers to the welfare state is tied to their need to compete, and desire to offer wages to productive employees
 - Employer solidarity in some sectors led to union solidarity in those sectors, as in Sweden, but non-union sectors undermined emergence of global solution

So one trajectory (Sweden's) appears to be: Employer solidarity leads to centralized wage setting, which in turn promotes a central welfare state and cross-sector solidarism
 - The USA trajectory: Employer lack of solidarity leads to bifurcated wage-setting, reinforcing divisions within society, and a weak/incomplete welfare state

[Thoughts: essentially, a blow to the tendency present in much of political-economy (social science in general) to present groups as homogeneous. Class, caste, ethnicity, gender - there is less uniformity than many scholars presume. Incentives matter, history matters. As an agent, labor is not inherently good just as management is not inherently bad, both are actors sharing a common environment who evolve and adapt over time]
