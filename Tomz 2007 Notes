Michael Tomz. 2007. Reputation and International Cooperation

[Brief: cooperation under the anarchic conditions presumed in effect in the international system presents difficulties to theory. In absence of effective sanctions, as is the case when individuals/groups lend to sovereign nations, why take the risk? Tomz argues that reputation is key. Actors have memory, and update beliefs about prospective partners. They take into account environmental conditions, and accord reputation to an agent, which controls their willingness to cooperate in the future. Reputation is thus an essential factor in cooperation under anarchy]


From a realist/presumed anarchy perspective, willingness to lend to sovereign entities is problematic. Why does anyone expect to be repaid, why does any state repay?
 - With no guaranteed enforcement mechanism present, cooperation poses a problem for this theoretical perspective. Why do agents cooperate in absence of the Leviathan?

Issue further complicated by the fact that nations do default, rather frequently. Yet lending continues, even to former defaulting nations, implying something at play
 - Typically scholars adopt a 'repeat game' or 'issue linkage' explanation; enforcement by retaliation and punishment in another issue area

However neither perspective is backed by the empirical evidence, and both arguments are difficult to sustain given persistence of lending and default in international system
 - Fixing their inadequacies by invoking 'incomplete information' isn't sufficient, and ignores that despite lack of 'complete' info the system still mostly functions

Reputational Theory posits a different mechanism underpinning continued interaction: lender decisions influenced by history and context of past interactions
 - Lenders look at what information they do have, even incomplete, and assign prospective lenders into 3 basic categories (lemon/mixed/stalwart), with different assumed behavior

History of steady repayment improves borrower reputation with lenders over time, and repayment despite adversity is noted as a sign of a borrower's type/category
 - Conversely, a poor repayment history undermines reputation, particularly if borrowers default without adequate justification

Lemons, those borrowers that acquire a reputation for unreliability, experience credit embargo or high risk premiums when they go onto market seeking funds
 - Stalwarts, those borrows that acquire a reputation for reliability, can obtain financing at significantly lower rates and have little difficulty finding lenders

Mixed types are intermediary in the scale, with accordingly mixed rates and default histories. But movement in/through tied to repayment and environmental conditions
 - Lemons are allowed to borrow eventually, however, the rates are high to make being classed a lemon less than ideal, while stalwart status confers benefits

Empirical evidence of lending across the past two centuries confirms that rates are tied to reputation, as measured by past history of repayment/default
 - Lenders are clearly willing to accept risk, and do not permanently bar lemons, but will charge them appropriate premiums - risk accepted, but managed

Little evidence supports the idea that lenders simply cut off lemons entirely, or that military force (gunboats) are used to collect on debts in most cases
 - Sovereign governments rarely intervene on behalf of creditors, military actions tied to debt actually in most cases are due to other factors

Many sovereign nations have stated in diplomatic discussions a belief that lenders take risk of their own accord, and have no claim on military force to seek repayment
 - Repayment is typically decoupled from other issues even where lenders try to bundle it in, so issue linkage not a leading explanation for evidence

Case of Argentina in the 19th century is illustrative, with the country avoiding default even when economic conditions were dire and lenders might have accepted default as necessary
 - Evidence indicates that the underlying reason for repayment was an active desire to access credit markets at a later date, implying fear of restricted access impacted behavior

Australia, similarly, despite only entering credit markets in the late 19th century, rapidly demonstrated a committment to repayment and saw interest rates decline
 - There too debt repayment was seen as a wise choice ensuring future access to credit, implying the nation's reputation was important to policy-makers

Empirics drawn from the 20th century further undermine the idea that power/force is widely applied in creditor-borrower relations, with power of creditor not impacting default risk
 - Where defaults occur, lenders appear to react by embargo/punishment for the short term, followed by renewed access with high risk premiums, but no use of force

The implication for theory is that the global political economy persists despite anarchic conditions because reputation alters willingness to cooperate
 - Agents update beliefs based on information, and act within their sphere to punish bad behavior as they can, but wars are not tied to debt

Lenders effectively allow borrowers to self-differentiate their 'type' by using repayment history as an indicator, and then tie apparent type to lending conditions
 - They minimize their losses suffered to lemons, and also create an incentive for repayment by threatening future restriction of credit access

They often prove quite effective at discerning the true type of a prospective borrower, using even limited information to glean likelihood of repayment
 - Even under conditions of anarchy, they take risks and update beliefs after the fact after observing the results

Cooperation is thus sustained by all parties, who see the benefit to self in entering the game according to the existing parameters - and continue to do so
 - This implies that reputation can strongly impact international relations and allow for a control/cooperation mechanism even under anarchic conditions
