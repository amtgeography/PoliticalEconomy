Besley, 2006. Principled Agents

In brief: Application of economic theory/reasoning to consider government failure as an analog to market failure. Roots argument in individualist rationalism, backed by formal logic and limited empirics.

Chapter 1: Competing views on Government

Economic theory tends to theorize government two ways: defender of public OR private interest
 - Essentially a way to mitigate market failure OR a site for rent seeking [welfare econ vs. Pub Choice]

Besley emphasizes resource allocation via principle-agent interactions as core of government
 - Structure matters greatly, but agent incentives drive their behavior within the structure

The two major economic schools of thought each offers logical and opposing prescriptions for govt
 - but both leave gaps in explanation, objective of this book to offer another perspective

As with the difficulty in theorizing government, "good" government also contested
 - Political Economy is relatively young and developing rapidly, still working such matters out

But neither standard approach can address important questions of how/why polticians go for office
 - It is clear that democracy is heavily influenced by agent/actor incentives as office holders

Chapter 2: Anatomy of Government Failure 

Governments fail, but in general the reasons are poorly theorized - resource allocation failure key
 - Political failure here considered a subset of government failure, focused on democracies alone

3 Primary types of government failure: pareto, social welfare, Wicksellian
 - Essentially, failure to be efficient versus wrong/biased welfare choice versus liberty constriction

Pareto logic (inefficiency) too weak, Wicksellian is too stringent a criteria
 - but the social welfare approach presumes knowing what social welfare function is valued by people

Ignorance (lack of information), Influence (corruption and/or rent seeking), Leadership quality vital
 - Can't be efficient with bad info, incentives to cheat are always present, need good leaders

Political failures (as subset) stem from issues in the voting process as well as bargaining/logrolling
 - Hard to pin down these and their effects

Adding a temporal dimension naturally complicates analysis, with linkages over time playing role
 - So the architecture of the system needs to be better understood, it plays crucial role

Chapter 3: Political Agency and Accountability

Principle-Agent frame connects the public (principal) with the politician (agent)
 - inverted from the usual use in economics, where gov't maximizes welfare and observes preferences

Incentive problems arise due to politician's information advantage as a result of position
 - Monitoring for opportunistic behavior and selection for competent politicians crucial

Elections are supposed to solve the information problem, but this is a huge (asknowledged) assumption
 - Ideally constitutional arrangements/architecture prevent major distortions, too complex to deal with here

At heart of the P-A formulation is the mitigation of moral hazard, tie agents to principal's wishes
 - Good behavior must be rewarded and bad behavior punished (from perspective of principal)

Agency model essentially time-sequentiual game, politicians versus agents
 - Politicians hold power/control policy so long as they are re-elected, effectively drawn from a pool

4 key issues to consider:
 - Uncertainty: over what voters can observe, agent self-perception, actual effects of policy
 - Motivations: Politicians could "care"/be faithful, or they could be rent or legacy seeking
 - Accountability: Agency held by group (like a party) is more complex [multiple individual sub-agents]
 - Retrospective Voting: Actual voter behavior vague in reality, how much info they have unknown

Combining a Moral Hazard model (rent-seeking agents) with Adverse Selection model (punished pols) useful
 - baseline model used allows for retrospective voting, models at two sequential time-steps/rounds

Prop1: Congruent and Dissonant politician types, differentiated by elections + incumbent advantage
 - Elections force Dissonant pols (rent-seeking) to mimic Congruent (faithful agent) pols 

Evidence from US Governor dataset supports term limit effect, govs get punished for raising taxes
 - But non running govs face no punishment, and are willing to be Congruent (from party perspective)

Prop 2: Non-partisan voter welfare decreased when incumbent has advantage
 - implication, lower levels of polarization and low noise-voting and balanced competition = good govt

But it is important to note that good politicans MUST be rewarded, or bad politicians gain an advantage
 - Noise voting over policy-inconsequential matters is damaging, incurs information costs on voters

Prop 3: Voter welfare goes up with increased information IFF info is policy relevant
 - In cases where noise voting/irrelevant info is high & "good" politician pool is shallow = BAD

Prop 4: Dissonant politicians choose behavior strategy based on voters in order to survive
 - But voter strategies interact, are complicated, so Dissonant pols can hide

Prop 5: No term limits will tend to discipline Dissonant politicians
Prop 6: More patient dissonant politicians will tend to conform to preserve what rents they hold

Multiple agents in the system complicates for all agents, competition incurs costs among them
 - But because of added costs and noise, dissonant politicans can go lax on their discipline

Prop 7: Dissonant-type politicians tie their behavior to anticipated/realized rents
 - So if there are to be multiple agents, then these agents must be forced to compete

All in all, this reasoning seems to bear out Putnams arguments with respect to democracy
 - an unanswered question is how much rationality actually matters to this perspective

Chapter 4: Public Agency & Public Finance   &  Chapter 5: Concluding Thoughts

If governments were benevolent, then any restrictions on them would reduce voter welfare
 - So recognizing the reality of imperfect government, rules are necessary. Good ones, well considered

Political Theory of the Second-Best by [Fisher & Summers 1989] via [Lipsey & Lancaster 1956]
 - Basically, because the world never fits our ideals, we have to hedge by accepting 2nd-best solutions

Good politicians and bad politicians in this model assume the bad ones are strategic and rent-seeking
 - the "leviathan" model [Brennan & Buchannan] assumes that ALL are bad, which is just a special case

In a pure adverse selkection model, either all bad & some politicians get re-elected, or no bad & some good do
 - Either way raising taxes incurs a cost on politicians, and only remedy is to have good pols in pool

Pure moral hazard model will indicate that all politician rent-seeking opportunities must be constrained
 - Agency problems may lead to smaller government in this scenario, with lower capacity

So if you combine both extreme types of model, you can create an equilibrium space useful for analysis
 - but many other issues remain, including inefficiencies in tax systems, working elections, and differentiated politicians
