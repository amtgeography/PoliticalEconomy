Acemoglu & Robinson 2006: Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy

Brief: Presents a view of democratization as tied to rational behavior by characteristic agents engaged in time-sequenced game. Distinct economic classes with stable preferences contest level of economic distribution. Democratization results from inherent benefit of converting present-power into longer-lasting institutional power, and the outcome of contests between groups with different amounts and types of power. Utilizes economic reasoning to derive Nash equilibrium for a number of relevant models, implying a simple underlying theoretical structure to democratization.

Part 1: Preface and Paths of Political Development

History and Institutions are what determine a nation's end-state level of democratization, whether consolidated, unconsolidated, non-democracy, or repressed/delayed democracy
 - democratization is effectively an inevitable process, with outcome of struggles between classes over time decisive in determing present-day level of democratization

UK serves as a model of gradual/inexorable democratization with consolidation, where parliaments established by aristocrats to counter royal taxation evolved over time
 - characterized by slow success over centuries of out-groups demanding the right to participate in the political process (vote)

Argentina models the unconsolidated type of democracy/trajectory, where coups and counter-coups form key part of recent political history
 - Essentially, it has slipped into and back out of democracy, depending on the balance of power in the country in a given crisis

Singapore presents an example of a successful non-democracy, or illiberal democracy, where pressures to democratize have not been strong
 - So the country is stable and yet non-democratic, which poses a challenge to views on inevitable democratization

South Africa represents the paradigmatic case of an unstable/delayed/repressed democracy, remaining mired in apartheid until relatively recently
 - White fears of a black majority melded together race and politics, producing a more volatile situation in theory and practice

Argument presumes a majority that is poor and a minority that is rich, with this latter group forming a ruling elite, the two classes locked in a sequential 'game'
 - poor want to force the rich to redistribute wealth via taxation, rich oppose this, and the character of the contest + balance of power are vital

Democracy is fundamentally about political equality, rather than control over society being exerted by a privileged subset, which can rig the game
 - Equality matters because if individuals are assumed to have defined preferences, they will tend to act rationally to pursue them - rich have more resources

Any policy can be expected to have distributional implications, because pareto conditions rarely achieved in practice, so there will be 'losers'
 - Contest and conflict are inevitable, and the fight is often waged over institutions (like government) that can alter the future balance of power in society

These institutions offer the ability to take momentary, present-period (often fleeting) power and convert it into something longer-lasting
 - Democratic institutions give the majority greater power to control policy, particularly tax rates and redistribution of wealth

In non-democracy, citizens do have power, but it is primarily tied to their ability to surmount collective action problems and revolt
 - Elites can choose to repress, but both revolution and repression incur costs on participants, that leaves both worse off - compromise is beneficial

A number of factors impact this struggle, and help determine the democratization trajectory observed both in initial formation of democracy and long-term consolidation
 - Civil society, existing political institutions, identity of participants and nature of their conflicts, sources and type of income/wealth, level of inequality, middle class

Part 2: Modeling Politics

Arrow's theorem argues that individual rational actors preferences are not easily aggregated, no pareto-optimal outcomes really possible - there will be winners/losers
 - Still, assuming that voters have single-peaked, rank-ordered preferences, Black's median voter theorem implies that median voter preferences are decisive

Downsian policy convergence argues that given the median voter theorem, parties in a democracy will tend to adopt similar policies
 - Given that the median voter is on the poorer side in the 2-class model, democracy will tend to result in redistribution by default

When conflicts between distinct classes are modeled over time, distinct strategies governed by Nash equilibrium (unique to each model) result
 - In a non-democratic society, the costs of revolution and repression are the key constraints governing long-term path towards democratization

Olson's view on collective action problems useful, demonstrates the costs inherent in coordinating a revolution across a broad society
 - Individual choice to defect where rational creates need for enforcement institutions to keep the collective coherent

Prop 5.1: For elites, cost of repression determine willingness to make democratic concessions in face of threat of revolt
Prop 5.2: But elites have a problem: they cannot credibly commit to not use their disproportionate control over repression mechanisms to renege on concessions
Prop 5.3: Elites can and will alter their strategy as required and even concede to the masses, but meaningless if they aren't trusted

Part 3: The Creation and Consolidation of Democracy

Institutions are the instrument that allow elites to surmount their problem of lacking credibility, they allow conversion of temporary into formal power
 - Power is always shifting, and so elites have an incentive to institutionalize a present-time advantage wherever possible

Prop 6.1: When inequality grows, revolution pressures grow, concessions become required, but committment becomes an even larger issue
 - because disparities in power, tied to disparities in wealth, make it even harder to trust the good will of the elites

Prop 6.2: When elites cannot credibly commit, their only choice is to repress, with the outcome being decided largely by power of revolt
 - This produces non-monotonic relationship, where too much inequality produces perpetual repression but too low inequality undermines revolt incentives

Prop 6.3: Democracy arises when repression is costly enough that elites lose (either by conceding or physically losing)
Prop 6.4: Concentration of power/wealth in elite hands becomes destabilizing, so inequality is a fundmental driving factor in democratization
Prop 6.5: Ideology can play a crucial role, altering perceived costs and creating party structures that may further distort situation
Prop 6.6: Increasing inequality, all else equal, makes the decision to repress more likely because stakes are higher if redistribution happens

Some inequality is necessary to produce the difference between rich/poor elite/masses that drives further political competition
 - too low, and no one bothers to revolt or repress, but too high and elites always choose to repress, so middling levels conducive to democratization

Prop 7.1: Coups represent an elite attempt to influence future redistribution, where democracy/redistribution poses high threat
Prop 7.2: Citizens tend to always prefer democracy, but elites tend to split along hardline/softline divide, so tendency towards gradual democratization
Prop 7.3: Coups tend to occur where democracy threatens too much redistribution, with type of wealth held by elites important

Part 4: Putting the Models to Work [Part 5 - Conclusion re-states most of above]

Role of the middle class is very important, including in models as an intermediary actor adds richness and realism
 - Barrington Moore credited with bringing particular emphasis to the role of the middle class in determining outcome of democratization

Presence of a strong middle class is a major factor in Europe's trajectory of gradual movement to and consolidation of democracy
 - It functions as a buffer between more extreme interests of rich and poor, in co-opting poor will create acceptable pace of reform

Prop 8.1: Middle class creates a pull towards democracy, acting as a miniature (less threatening) alternative to the poor
 - Balance of power again key, with strong middle class using poor's numbers as leverage to negotiate democratic reform, weak middle class tends to bandwagon

Prop 8.2: Strong middle class mitigates repression, and a weak middle class tends to produce a higher tendency towards only partial democratization
Prop 8.3: Elites tend to democratize in the wake of failed repression, likely due to influence of middle class
Prop 8.4: Any split among the elites tends to aid democratization, unless the middle class is too rich relative to the poor and opposes redistribution
Prop 8.5: Elites less likely to launch coup when middle class is strong, as they will buffer poor demands for redistribution

Land is a crucial underlying factor, as it is immobile capital and often entirely under elite control for reasons of history (and colonialism)
 - Landed elites capital is vulnerable to appropriation and not easily subdivided without elites losing control, so they fight for it

Industrial capital is both more fungible and more likely to be owned by or in other ways tied to the middle class, and partially mobile
 - Industrial elites are on the whole less likely to favor repression and can more easily protect their interests in democracy via role as employers

Concluding Thoughts [Mine]

 - Perspective shares the strengths and weaknesses of all economic reasoning relying on rational individuals as the basic unit of analysis
 - Intuitive, and broadly accurate portrayal of the historic processes, adding credibility to the models (again, broadly)
 - Suffers from the same democracy-as-inevitable bias as many works in western science rooted in assessment of Western European history
 - Offers excellent predictive capabilities subject to further investigation, and insights into the contemporary American political crisis
 - If tied to a systems ecology view of multiple agents interacting in a resource-constrained ecosystem (complex adaptive system), likely get very interesting insights 
 - Curiosity: if individual preferences are systematically unstable, lacking clearly defined peaks, better to assume multiple equilibria? What then of Nash equilibrium logic?
